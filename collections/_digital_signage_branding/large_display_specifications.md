### Programming Policy

It is the policy of the Austin Convention Center that these screens will not be dedicated to any single client for exclusive usage, as events for multiple clients may run simultaneously in-house. Screens will be used primarily for client content and wayfinding, to run concurrently with ACCD promotional programming such as amenities and catering services.
