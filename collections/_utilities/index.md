We provide all utilities as an exclusive service including, but not limited to, electrical, water and drain, gas, compressed air and telephone services. We ask that clients make utility service order forms available to exhibitors at least thirty (30) days before the first contract date. Clients are responsible for utility services costs assessed at the prevailing rate.

- Permanent facility outlets are not considered part of an exhibitor’s booth space.
- Certain utilities may be limited to specific areas within the building. (i.e. gas and water).
- Electrical equipment must be underwriter laboratory approved.
- Our electrical equipment (extension cords, distribution boxes, etc.) should not be removed by exhibitors, service contractors, or other personnel.
- The exhibit hall utility door pockets are located on thirty-foot (30’) centers. Exhibit plan layouts should be designed accordingly. Exhibit floor plans not aligned on thirty-foot (30’) centers may be assessed additional charges and may not be accessible for utility services to booths. Some utility services may not be accessible for some booths.
- An exhibitor list, both in alphabetical and numerical order, is required so prompt service may be provided to exhibitors. Services ordered and not used are not credited or refunded.
- Clients and Contractors are not permitted to up-charge for services.
- Unscheduled labor may be subject to the overtime charges of one and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate.

- Over payment for utility services is only considered when our personnel is notified before the end of the event at which over payment was made.
